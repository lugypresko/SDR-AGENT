We are building a fully-autonomous SDR Engine powered by AI agents, designed to generate deeply personalized, high-quality outreach to senior Israeli tech executives — consistently, safely, and at scale.

This is not “email automation”.
It is a precision, multi-agent intelligence system that thinks, decides, and writes like a senior SDR with 10 years of domain expertise.

🎯 CORE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

Companies (or solo consultants like you) who sell to CTOs/VP R&D struggle with:

Writing emails that feel personal instead of templated

Understanding the subtle context of each company

Knowing the CTO’s unspoken pains

Keeping consistency across 100+ leads

Ensuring high open rates and relevance

Scaling outreach without damaging reputation

The traditional tools (Apollo, outreach, Instantly) fail because they are:

Template-based

Not context-aware

Not emotionally intelligent

Not decision-driven

Not built for Israeli tech culture

We fix that.

🛠️ WHAT WE ARE BUILDING (PRODUCT VISION)

A multi-agent pipeline that:

Reads a lead from a CSV

Researches and enriches context

Profiles pains & signals

Chooses the most strategic angle

Writes a high-quality, 140-word cold email

Self-validates the email for quality

Outputs ready-to-send personalized outreach

Each agent is specialized, predictable, and governed by strict constraints.

🧠 WHY MULTI-AGENT?

Because one monolithic LLM fails.
We need specialization + boundaries:

Enrichment Agent → “Who is this company?”

Pain Profiler → “Where does it hurt?”

Angle Router → “What do we talk about?”

Email Writer → “What’s the right message?”

Quality Agent → “Is this safe, relevant, and sharp?”

This architecture mimics how a real SDR team operates — but faster, smarter, and cheaper.

🧵 WHAT MAKES OUR SYSTEM UNIQUE
1. Identity-level personalization

Emails feel written for one specific CTO, not a category.

2. Israel-native communication style

Short
Direct
Zero-BS
Emotionally sharp
High signal
Mobile optimized

3. Precision control

The system works under:

strict contracts

hard boundaries

deterministic flows

minimal viable changes

No surprises. No AI hallucinations.

4. Signature-level authority

Every email also reinforces who you are, why you matter, and why a CTO can trust you instantly.

📈 WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
For the product:

80–90%+ email approval without rewrites

Stable output across 250 leads

No hallucinations

No context drift

Emails that FEEL handcrafted

For the business:

Higher open rates

Outreach becomes predictable and scalable

🚀 LONG-TERM POTENTIAL

Enrichment scrapers

Target decisioning

ICP refinement

Calendar-booking agent

All powered by the same contract-first architecture.
